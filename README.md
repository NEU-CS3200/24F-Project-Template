# StartUpConnect 
## A FullStack Application to Connect Students and Startups

This repo is a semester project for Database Management. We are creating a platform that uses backend code, an API, Flask, SQL, and some front-end/UI tools to create a holistic product to help students on co-op connect with startups.

## What is StartUpConnect?
StartUpConnect helps Northeastern take its experiential learning to the next level by
connecting the relevant people to actual startups that need help. By matching students with startups based on their skills, co-op cycle, and what industries they want to enter, StartUpConnect facilitates connections and helps more students get hired at co-op experiences they want to do!

## Key Components
- Student-startup matching based on skills and availability.
- Career center analytics for placement success, industry trends, and personalized help.
- Feedback to continue to improve the experience for both students and companies.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Streamlit
- Docker
- SQL
- Mockaroo

## Current Project Components
### REST API
The backend is built using Flask and can be broken down into each user persona:

- Students: Uploading resumes, searching for internships, and co-op updates.
- Startups: Posting job opportunities, accepting and receiving candidate applications, and posting feedback for co-ops.
- Northeastern Career Center: Viewing analytics on placements and skills trends.
- Post-Grads: Platform to view full-time job opportunities and feedback on specific startups.

### Streamlit
The front end is built using Streamlit
- Provides dashboards for different types of users (personas)
- Interacts with the back-end to query real time results
