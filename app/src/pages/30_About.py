    COUPE is a data-driven platform designed to revolutionize the Co-Op search process for Northeastern students by providing peer-to-peer insights into specific company experiences. While platforms like NUWorks provide job listings, they often fall short in detailing the real day-to-day life, culture, and interview dynamics students will encounter. COUPE fills this gap by giving students a space to share and access honest feedback about what it‚Äôs truly like working for various employers‚Äîcovering everything from workplace culture to interview formats and application tips.
