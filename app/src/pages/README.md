# `pages` Folder

This folder contains all the pages that will be part of the application. Details on required numbers will be provided in the Phase 3 documentation.

These pages are meant to show you an example of some of the features of Streamlit and the way we will limit functionality access by role/persona. It is not meant to represent a complete application.

The pages are labeled with a name and number, with the latter representing grouping of the pages based on similarity of information or to represent the limited view of particular users.
